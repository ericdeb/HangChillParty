# HangChillParty.com

## Overview

Sometime during undergrad, a friend and I expressed our frusteration with determining who was available to hang out on a weekend evening. From this need, HangChillParty.com was born, and it was my first major web development project. My friend and I decided to live in Berkely, CA for the summer in 2010 and work on the idea (he designed the site and handled the business end while I developed). Although there were many previous iterations, the final iteration was developed in about eight weeks. It peaked at more than a 1000 users and was being used regularly by about 20 or 30 users at any one time. Unfortunately it did not gain traction, and we decided not to pursue the project further after I started grad school.

The site is very much a rich internet application and the only time a refresh occurs is when moving from login.php to index.php. It was built using the standard LAMP stack (Apache, MySQL, PHP, and JavaScript - Jquery).
